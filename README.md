# pr-explore

Due to time constraints, I’ll focus on delivering the MVP first and adding the nice to haves if there’s any time left over. All tasks required for this project will be broken down into issues and given a numbered priority below:

## Must haves

1. Research the Github API https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/1
2. Setup empty project template https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/2
3. Establish design patterns https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/3
4. Accounts component https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/4
5. Repos component https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/5
6. PRs component https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/6
7. App component https://github.com/GregDevProjects/pr-explore/issues/7

## Nice to haves

1. Add four evenly sized elements to the bottom of the app 
2. Unit tests
3. Pagination for the repositories/prs/accounts
4. Use authenticated requests for the Github API 
5. Update the URL when a Repo is selected, so that application state can be bookmarked/shared 
6. A way to filter/search for repositories/prs/accounts
